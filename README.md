=============
The current plan is to use [discord](https://discord.gg/VEQmm) and Github for the day to day comms.

This is the fork of the J2 fork of thejasperproject, thank you for all the work to this point and hope to merge back up with yall on the main project.

Client code for the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications.

This fork is a work in progress and as such if you find something missing/broke/anything please make a pull request with tests would be nice, or file an issue.

There are plenty of things that need help.  If you have to ask your not looking at the code.

The documentation is the first thing.


If you have a jasper working install then you should only need to do the following:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools 
sudo pip install -r Jasper2fork/python_requirements.txt 
  
```

For further information (installation, setup ...), please, see the [WIKI](https://github.com/chrobione/Jasper2fork/wiki)
