=============

The current plan is to use [Discord](https://discord.gg/kSnVC9C) and Github for the day to day comms.

NOTE: Jasper2fork is currently on break since few months, but some members on Discord still can help you if you have issues.

This is the fork of the J2 fork of thejasperproject, thank you for all the work to this point and hope to merge back up with yall on the main project.

Client code for the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications.

This fork is a work in progress and as such if you find something missing/broke/anything please make a pull request with tests would be nice, or file an issue.

There are [plenty of things that need help](https://github.com/jasper2fork/j2f/issues). If you have to ask your not looking at the code.

The documentation is the first thing.

You can find installations steps [here](https://github.com/jasper2fork/j2f/wiki/Installation-steps-for-Jasper2Fork)

For further information (setup...), please look at the [WIKI](https://github.com/jasper2fork/j2f/wiki)
